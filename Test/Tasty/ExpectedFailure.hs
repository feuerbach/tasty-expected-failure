-- | Marks all tests in the give test as expected failures: The tests will
-- still be run, but if they succeed, it is reported as a test suite failure,
-- and conversely a the failure of the test is ignored.
--
-- Any output of a failing test is still printed.
--
-- This is useful if, in a test driven development, tests are written and
-- commited to the master branch before their implementation: It allows the
-- tests to fail (as expected) without making the whole test suite fail.
--
-- Similarly, regressions and bugs can be documented in the test suite this
-- way, until a fix is commited, and if a fix is applied (intentionally or
-- accidentially), the test suite will remind you to remove the 'expectFail'
-- marker.
